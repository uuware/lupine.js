# lupine.api

lupine.api is a fast, lightweight, and flexible node.js based server framework. It is designed to work seamlessly with [lupine.web](https://github.com/uuware/lupine.web) to provide Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and modern API capabilities.

The project consists of two main parts:

1.  **Server (`src/app`)**: A robust HTTP/HTTPS server that manages multiple applications, domains, and processes.
2.  **API Module (`src/api`)**: A framework for building the backend logic for individual applications.
