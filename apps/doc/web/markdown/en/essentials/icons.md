## Icons Font Customization

Lupine.js seamlessly integrates with my other independent project, [Icons Font Customization](https://github.com/uuware/icons-font-customization), to provide you with over 78,000 high-quality free icons.

[Icons Font Customization](https://github.com/uuware/icons-font-customization) is a powerful icon collection and tool that allows you to:

- **Massive Collection**: Access over 78,000+ icons from sources like Font Awesome, Material Design, and more.
- **Full Customization**: Mix and match icons from different sources, selecting only what you truly need, thereby drastically reducing the font file size.
- **Custom Styles**: Adjust icon color, background, and size before generation.
- **Automatic Generation**: Generate font files (woff2, woff, ttf) and accompanying CSS/HTML with a single click.
